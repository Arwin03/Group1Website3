 <h2>We’re making incredible progress against tobacco:</h2>
 <li>In the U.S., our work has helped drive smoking rates to record lows.</li>
<li>Around the world, we’re helping to turn the tide of a global tobacco epidemic that would otherwise kill one billion people this century.</li>

<h3>But the battle against tobacco is far from over:</h3>
<li>Tobacco still kills nearly half a million Americans and more than 8 million people worldwide each year.</li>
<li>The tobacco industry relentlessly peddles its deadly products, targeting kids and other vulnerable populations.</li>
<li>Youth e-cigarette use remains a serious public health problem, with 14.1% of U.S. high school students reporting current use of e-cigarettes in 2022.</li>
<center>
Our remarkable progress shows that we can win the fight against tobacco. The Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids is unyielding in our resolve and committed to finishing the job.
